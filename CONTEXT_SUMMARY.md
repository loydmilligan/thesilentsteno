# The Silent Steno - Development Context Summary

## Project Overview
**The Silent Steno** is a Bluetooth AI Meeting Recorder built on Raspberry Pi 5 that acts as an invisible audio intermediary between a phone and headphones. It captures meeting audio for AI-powered transcription and analysis while maintaining transparent, low-latency audio forwarding.

## Current Development Status

### Branch Structure
- **`main` branch**: Working Kivy version with AI analysis improvements
- **`feature/modern-web-ui` branch**: New modern web UI implementation (CURRENT)

### Key Achievements Completed
1. ✅ **Walking Skeleton Complete**: Basic end-to-end recording and transcription working
2. ✅ **AI Analysis Integration**: Enhanced SimpleTranscriber with sentiment, topics, action items, questions, summaries
3. ✅ **Production Architecture Bridge**: WalkingSkeletonAdapter for seamless component integration
4. ✅ **Modern Web UI**: Flask-based touch-optimized interface matching prototype design
5. ✅ **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for live recording updates and transcription status

### Current Implementation Details

#### Working Components (main branch)
- **`minimal_demo_refactored.py`**: Fully functional Kivy app with AI analysis
- **`src/ai/simple_transcriber.py`**: Enhanced with AI analysis capabilities
- **`src/integration/walking_skeleton_adapter.py`**: Bridges skeleton and production components
- **Database integration**: SQLite with session management (temporarily disabled due to conflicts)
- **Audio recording**: Working with Bluetooth audio input via PulseAudio
- **Transcription**: Whisper base model with real-time processing
- **AI Analysis**: Word count, sentiment, topics, action items, questions, summaries

#### Modern Web UI (feature/modern-web-ui branch)
- **`web_ui.py`**: Flask application with Socket.IO
- **`templates/index.html`**: Modern dark theme UI (violet/slate colors)
- **Three main views**: Session list, Live recording, Session detail
- **Real-time features**: Recording timer, waveform visualization, transcription updates
- **Touch-optimized**: Designed for Pi touchscreen (1024x600)
- **Session management**: Card-based layout with participant avatars

### Technical Architecture
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi 5 with 3.5-5" touchscreen
- **Audio**: BlueZ Bluetooth stack with A2DP, ALSA/PulseAudio
- **AI Models**: Local Whisper (base) for transcription, simple pattern matching for analysis
- **Storage**: SQLite database + JSON fallback, local file storage (WAV)
- **UI Options**: Kivy (main branch) or Flask web UI (feature branch)

### Known Issues & Status
1. **Kivy App Crashes**: The integrated demo still has database integration conflicts
2. **Database Integration**: Temporarily disabled due to schema conflicts
3. **Audio Input**: Works with Bluetooth audio, requires actual speech input (not silence)
4. **Desktop Icons**: Execute dialog still appears on desktop (works from applications menu)

### Testing Status
- **Audio Recording**: ✅ Working with Bluetooth input
- **Transcription**: ✅ Working with Whisper base model
- **AI Analysis**: ✅ Working with pattern matching
- **Web UI**: ✅ Basic functionality implemented, needs testing with real audio
- **Real-time Updates**: ✅ Socket.IO communication working

### Next Priority Tasks
1. **Test Modern Web UI**: Run `./run_web_ui.sh` and test with real audio recording
2. **Fix Database Integration**: Resolve schema conflicts for production use
3. **Desktop Entry**: Create proper desktop entry for web UI
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth operation on Pi 5 hardware
5. **Production Deployment**: Configure for fullscreen kiosk mode

### Development Commands
```bash
# Switch to working Kivy version
git checkout main
./run_demo_local.sh

# Switch to modern web UI
git checkout feature/modern-web-ui
./run_web_ui.sh
# Visit http://localhost:5000

# Install dependencies
source silentsteno_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Recent Development Context
Just completed implementing a modern web UI based on the prototype design. The UI features a sophisticated dark theme with violet accents, touch-optimized interface, real-time recording with animated waveforms, and comprehensive session management. The implementation uses Flask with Socket.IO for real-time communication and integrates with the existing walking skeleton adapter for backend functionality.

### Hardware Context
- **USB Audio Device**: Detected but shows 0 input channels (may be output-only)
- **Audio Input**: Using PulseAudio (device 4) with 32 input channels
- **Bluetooth**: Working for audio input from phone/device
- **Display**: Configured for 1024x600 Pi touchscreen in fullscreen mode

The project is at a critical juncture where the basic functionality is working well, and we're transitioning to a modern, professional UI that will make the system production-ready for meeting recording scenarios.
