# Manifest Evolution Log

This document tracks changes to the proposed final manifest as The Silent Steno project evolves.

## Initial Version - 2025-07-10

### Source
Created from initial project planning documents (MVP, PRD, and task breakdown) during project bootstrap.

### Key Components
- **Bluetooth Audio Proxy** - Dual A2DP connections for transparent audio forwarding
- **Real-time Audio Pipeline** - Low-latency capture and processing (<40ms target)
- **AI Processing Chain** - Local Whisper transcription + LLM analysis
- **Touch UI System** - Session management and live monitoring interface
- **Data Management Layer** - Local storage, export, and session organization

### Architecture Decisions
- **Local-First Processing** - All AI processing performed on-device using Whisper Base model and Phi-3 Mini LLM
- **Raspberry Pi 5 Platform** - Chosen for sufficient compute power and built-in Bluetooth/WiFi
- **Dual Bluetooth Strategy** - Device acts as both A2DP sink (for phone) and A2DP source (for headphones)
- **SQLite Data Storage** - Lightweight database for session metadata and transcripts
- **Touch-First UI** - Optimized for 3.5-5" touchscreen with minimal text input
- **Manifest-Driven Development** - Task-by-task implementation with git integration

### Performance Targets Set
- Audio latency: <40ms end-to-end
- Transcription lag: <3 seconds behind live audio
- Session start time: <10 seconds from tap to active
- Transcription accuracy: >90% for clear speech
- Session reliability: >99% completion rate

### Technology Stack Established
- **Platform:** Raspberry Pi 5 with touchscreen
- **Audio:** BlueZ Bluetooth stack with ALSA/PulseAudio
- **AI:** Local Whisper (Base model) + Phi-3 Mini LLM
- **Storage:** SQLite database + local file system
- **UI:** Touch-optimized interface (framework TBD during implementation)
- **Language:** Python as primary development language

### Development Phases Defined
1. **Foundation & Hardware Setup** (Tasks 1-3)
2. **Core Audio Processing** (Tasks 4-5)
3. **AI Integration** (Tasks 6-8)
4. **User Interface** (Tasks 9-11)
5. **Data Management** (Tasks 12-13)
6. **System Integration** (Tasks 14-15)
7. **Testing and Optimization** (Tasks 16-18)
8. **Deployment and Documentation** (Tasks 19-20)

### Critical Path Identified
Hardware Setup → Bluetooth Config → Audio Pipeline → Transcription → UI → Integration

### Key Assumptions
- Pi 5 has sufficient compute power for real-time Whisper Base transcription
- Bluetooth stack can handle simultaneous A2DP sink and source connections
- Local LLM can provide quality analysis within acceptable processing time
- Touch interface will be sufficient for device control without keyboard input

### Future Updates
Updates will be logged here as the project evolves through implementation phases. Key areas to monitor:

1. **Audio Performance** - Actual latency measurements vs. targets
2. **AI Model Performance** - Real-world accuracy and processing speed on Pi 5
3. **User Interface Decisions** - Framework selection and usability findings
4. **Integration Challenges** - Bluetooth reliability and system integration issues
5. **Hardware Limitations** - Any constraints discovered during development

Each major milestone or architectural discovery will be documented to track project evolution and inform future development decisions.
