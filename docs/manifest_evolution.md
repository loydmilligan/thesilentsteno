# Manifest Evolution Log

This document tracks changes to the proposed final manifest as The Silent Steno project evolves.

## Initial Version - 2025-07-10

### Source
Created from initial project planning documents (MVP, PRD, and task breakdown) during project bootstrap.

### Key Components
- **Bluetooth Audio Proxy** - Dual A2DP connections for transparent audio forwarding
- **Real-time Audio Pipeline** - Low-latency capture and processing (<40ms target)
- **AI Processing Chain** - Local Whisper transcription + LLM analysis
- **Touch UI System** - Session management and live monitoring interface
- **Data Management Layer** - Local storage, export, and session organization

### Architecture Decisions
- **Local-First Processing** - All AI processing performed on-device using Whisper Base model and Phi-3 Mini LLM
- **Raspberry Pi 5 Platform** - Chosen for sufficient compute power and built-in Bluetooth/WiFi
- **Dual Bluetooth Strategy** - Device acts as both A2DP sink (for phone) and A2DP source (for headphones)
- **SQLite Data Storage** - Lightweight database for session metadata and transcripts
- **Touch-First UI** - Optimized for 3.5-5" touchscreen with minimal text input
- **Manifest-Driven Development** - Task-by-task implementation with git integration

### Performance Targets Set
- Audio latency: <40ms end-to-end
- Transcription lag: <3 seconds behind live audio
