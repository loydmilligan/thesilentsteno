2. `analysis_scope` - User research scope (focused: 4 agents, standard: 6 agents, comprehensive: 8 agents, deep: 10 agents)
3. `output_dir` - Directory where user analysis reports will be saved

**PHASE 1: USER CONTEXT ANALYSIS**
Conduct preliminary analysis to understand user research requirements:
- Primary user interaction patterns and touchpoints
- User journey complexity and decision-making factors
- Demographic and psychographic considerations
- Use case scenarios and user goal hierarchies
- Technology adoption patterns and digital behavior
- Pain points and unmet needs in target domain

Establish comprehensive user research framework for specialized agent deployment.

**PHASE 2: EXISTING USER RESEARCH ASSESSMENT**
Examine the `output_dir` for previous user intelligence:
