claude-code "Validate and assess the success of a completed orchestrate_directory_manifest execution.

Start your response with: 'üîç **VALIDATE_ORCHESTRATION_RESULTS EXECUTING** - Auditing directory manifest orchestration with [FILTER_STRATEGY]'

## üìã REQUIRED INPUTS CHECK

Before proceeding, verify these inputs exist and are valid:

üîç **INPUT REQUIREMENTS:**

- ‚úÖ orchestration_summary.json exists in current directory
- ‚úÖ Repository structure is accessible for validation

## Task: Validate Orchestration Success

**Validation Target:** orchestration_summary.json
**Validation Scope:** Complete orchestration execution audit
**Output:** orchestration_validation_report.json

## Validation Process:

### 1. Load and Parse Orchestration Summary
- Read orchestration_summary.json from current directory
- Parse JSON structure and extract metadata
- Identify claimed successful and failed analyses
- Extract list of expected manifest file locations
- Note filter strategy and execution parameters

### 2. Manifest File Existence Validation

**File System Verification:**
- Verify each claimed manifest file actually exists at reported location
- Check file accessibility and readability
- Validate file sizes are reasonable (not empty or corrupted)
- Confirm files are in expected directories

**Missing File Detection:**
- Identify manifests claimed as "SUCCESS" but files missing
- Identify unexpected manifest files not in summary
- Document file permission issues or access problems

### 3. Manifest Content Quality Validation

**JSON Structure Validation:**
For each existing manifest file:
- Verify valid JSON structure (can be parsed)
- Check required fields are present (version, generated, analysis_scope, etc.)
- Validate metadata matches expectations
- Confirm file paths and directory names are consistent

**Content Completeness Assessment:**
- Verify manifest contains actual file analysis (not empty)
- Check for reasonable file counts and exports
- Validate dependency mappings are present
- Assess architecture analysis quality

### 4. Orchestration Accuracy Verification

**Summary vs Reality Comparison:**
- Compare claimed directory count vs actual directories analyzed
- Verify success/failure counts match actual manifest file results
- Validate filter strategy was applied correctly
- Check execution metrics for reasonableness

**Sub-Agent Performance Analysis:**
- Identify which sub-agents succeeded vs failed
- Analyze failure patterns and common error types
- Assess whether failed directories should have been processable
- Document any systematic issues with specific directory types

### 5. Repository Coverage Assessment

**Directory Coverage Analysis:**
- Scan repository structure to identify all qualifying directories
- Compare against orchestration targets to find missed directories
- Assess whether filter strategy was applied correctly
- Identify directories that should have been included but weren't

**Gap Analysis:**
- List directories with source code that were missed
- Identify over-inclusive analysis (wrong directories included)
- Check for depth limit compliance (max 3 levels)
- Document any scope creep or under-coverage

### 6. Quality Metrics Generation

**Success Rate Calculations:**
```
Overall Success Rate = (Successful Manifests / Total Attempted) * 100
File Existence Rate = (Existing Manifest Files / Claimed Successful) * 100
Content Quality Rate = (Valid JSON Manifests / Existing Files) * 100
Coverage Completeness = (Analyzed Directories / Target Directories) * 100
```

**Performance Assessment:**
- Execution time efficiency
- Sub-agent failure patterns
- Resource utilization assessment
- Batch processing effectiveness

### 8. Repository Structure Verification

**Independent Directory Scan:**
- Perform fresh scan of repository structure
- Apply same filter strategy as original orchestration
- Compare results to orchestration targets
- Identify any systematic filtering errors

**Depth Compliance Check:**
- Verify orchestration respected 3-level depth limit
- Check for any analysis beyond intended scope
- Validate directory categorization accuracy

- [ ] Accuracy assessment: [COMPLETED/FAILED]
- [ ] Coverage analysis: [COMPLETED/FAILED]
- [ ] Validation report: [GENERATED/FAILED] - orchestration_validation_report.json

**‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA MET** - Orchestration validation completed successfully
**‚ùå FAILURE** - Validation incomplete, cannot assess orchestration quality

## Validation Summary Report:
- **Orchestration Date**: [ORIGINAL_EXECUTION_DATE]
- **Filter Strategy**: [FILTER_STRATEGY_USED]
- **Overall Success Grade**: [A/B/C/D/F]
- **File Existence Rate**: [PERCENTAGE]% ([X/Y] files found)
- **Content Quality Rate**: [PERCENTAGE]% ([X/Y] valid manifests)
- **Coverage Completeness**: [PERCENTAGE]% ([X/Y] directories covered)
- **Sub-Agent Success Rate**: [PERCENTAGE]% ([X/Y] agents succeeded)
- **Primary Issues**: [COUNT] major issues identified
- **Recommendation**: [PROCEED/RETRY_FAILURES/FULL_RETRY/INVESTIGATE_ISSUES]

## Grading Scale:
- **Grade A (90-100%)**: Excellent execution, minimal issues, ready to proceed
- **Grade B (80-89%)**: Good execution, minor issues, mostly ready to proceed
- **Grade C (70-79%)**: Acceptable execution, some issues, may need selective retries
- **Grade D (60-69%)**: Poor execution, significant issues, requires remediation
- **Grade F (<60%)**: Failed execution, major issues, requires full retry or investigation

## Next Steps Based on Grade:
- **A/B**: Proceed with master manifest generation
- **C**: Address specific issues, retry failed directories
- **D**: Investigate systematic problems, retry with adjusted parameters
- **F**: Full retry of orchestration with corrected configuration

## Common Issues and Solutions:
- **Missing Manifest Files**: Check sub-agent error logs, verify directory permissions
- **Invalid JSON**: Re-run affected sub-agents, check for partial file writes
- **Low Coverage**: Verify filter strategy, check for missed directories
- **High Failure Rate**: Investigate systematic issues, check repository structure

The orchestration validation is complete. Review the detailed report to determine next steps for your repository manifest generation."
