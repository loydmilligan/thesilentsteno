# FEATURE SUGGESTION ORCHESTRATION COMMAND

Think deeply about this collaborative feature ideation task. You are about to orchestrate multiple specialized agents to generate comprehensive feature suggestions for a project concept.

**Variables:**

project_description: $ARGUMENTS
agent_count: $ARGUMENTS
output_dir: $ARGUMENTS

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `project_description` - Natural language description of the project idea
2. `agent_count` - Number of feature suggestion agents to deploy (default: 5, max: 12)
3. `output_dir` - Directory where feature analyses will be saved

**PHASE 1: PROJECT CONCEPT ANALYSIS**
Deeply analyze the project description to understand:
- Core project purpose and goals
- Target domain and industry context
- Technical complexity and scope
- User interaction patterns implied
- Innovation opportunities present
- Constraints and limitations suggested

Create comprehensive project context that will guide feature agent deployment.

**PHASE 2: OUTPUT DIRECTORY RECONNAISSANCE**
Examine the `output_dir` to understand current state:
- List existing feature analysis files
- Identify any previous feature suggestions
- Determine starting iteration number for new analyses
- Assess existing feature coverage to avoid duplication

**PHASE 3: FEATURE AGENT SPECIALIZATION STRATEGY**
Based on agent count and project analysis, assign specialized perspectives:

**For 5 Agents (Standard Deployment):**
- Agent 1: **Core Functionality Specialist** - Essential features for MVP
- Agent 2: **User Experience Innovation** - Advanced UX/UI features  
- Agent 3: **Technical Infrastructure** - Backend, security, performance features
- Agent 4: **Business Value Creator** - Monetization, analytics, growth features
- Agent 5: **Future Vision Architect** - Cutting-edge, forward-looking features

**For 8+ Agents (Extended Deployment):**
- Add: **Accessibility Champion** - Inclusive design features
- Add: **Mobile-First Designer** - Mobile-specific capabilities
- Add: **Integration Specialist** - Third-party and API features
- Add: **Data Intelligence** - AI/ML and analytics features

**PHASE 4: PARALLEL AGENT COORDINATION**
Deploy specialized feature suggestion agents with sophisticated coordination:

**Agent Distribution Strategy:**
- For count 3-6: Launch all agents simultaneously for maximum diversity
- For count 7-12: Launch in waves of 6 agents to manage coordination complexity

**Feature Agent Assignment Protocol:**
Each Specialized Agent receives:
1. **Project Context**: Complete analysis of project description and goals
2. **Specialization Role**: Specific feature domain and perspective to explore
3. **Existing Features**: Summary of any previously suggested features to avoid duplication
4. **Innovation Directive**: Instruction to push boundaries within their specialization
5. **Quality Standards**: Requirements for detailed, actionable feature descriptions
6. **Feasibility Framework**: Guidance on balancing innovation with practical implementation

**Feature Agent Task Specification:**
```
TASK: Generate innovative feature suggestions for [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION] - Specialization: [ROLE]

You are Specialized Feature Agent [X] with expertise in [SPECIALIZATION_DOMAIN].

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Project Description: [Full project analysis]
- Core Goals: [Primary objectives and success metrics]
- Target Users: [Implied user base and use cases]

Innovation Mandate: Push creative boundaries while maintaining practical viability

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate 8-12 detailed feature suggestions within your specialization
2. For each feature provide:
   - Feature Name and Brief Description
   - User Value Proposition (why users would want this)
   - Technical Implementation Overview (how it could be built)
   - Priority Level (Critical/High/Medium/Future)
   - Dependencies (what other features/systems it requires)
   - Innovation Factor (how cutting-edge or unique it is)
3. Ensure features complement rather than duplicate other specializations
4. Consider scalability, security, and user experience in all suggestions
5. Include at least 2 "moonshot" features that are highly innovative
6. Provide rationale for why each feature fits the project vision

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Create detailed feature analysis with clear categorization and actionable descriptions.
File naming: feature_analysis_[SPECIALIZATION]_[TIMESTAMP].md
```

**Parallel Execution Management:**
- Launch all assigned Feature Agents simultaneously using Task tool
- Monitor agent progress and specialization coverage
- Handle any agent failures by reassigning specialization roles
- Ensure no overlap between agent specialization domains
- Collect and validate all completed feature analyses

**Context Optimization:**
- Each agent receives focused context relevant to their specialization
- Main orchestrator maintains lightweight coordination state
- Progressive feature cataloging to prevent duplication across waves
- Strategic context pruning for subsequent agent waves

**PHASE 5: FEATURE SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS**

After all Feature Agents complete their analyses:

**Comprehensive Feature Compilation:**
1. **Aggregate All Features**: Collect features from all specialization agents
2. **Categorization Matrix**: Organize features by:
   - Implementation Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Future)
   - Technical Complexity (Simple/Moderate/Complex/Advanced)
   - User Impact (Core/Enhanced/Convenience/Delight)
   - Innovation Level (Standard/Innovative/Cutting-edge/Moonshot)

**Feature Frequency Analysis:**
1. **Convergent Features**: Identify features suggested by multiple agents from different specializations
2. **Unique Innovations**: Highlight features suggested by only one specialization
3. **Theme Patterns**: Identify recurring themes across specializations
4. **Gap Analysis**: Note areas where no agent provided suggestions

**Strategic Feature Summary:**
Create executive summary including:
- **Top 10 Consensus Features** (most frequently suggested across specializations)
- **Innovation Highlights** (most creative/cutting-edge suggestions)
- **Implementation Roadmap** (suggested development phases)
- **Resource Requirements** (estimated complexity and effort)
- **Competitive Advantages** (features that could differentiate the project)
