## Quick Start

### Desktop Launcher
1. **Install desktop launcher:**
   ```bash
   cp silent_steno_demo.desktop ~/Desktop/
   chmod +x ~/Desktop/silent_steno_demo.desktop
   ```

2. **Double-click the "Silent Steno Demo" icon** on your desktop to launch

### Command Line Launch
```bash
cd /home/mmariani/projects/thesilentsteno
python3 demo_live_session.py
```

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi 5 with touchscreen (3.5" or 5" recommended)
- Python 3.11+ with Kivy installed
- Project files in `/home/mmariani/projects/thesilentsteno`

### Verification
```bash
# Test imports
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('src')
from src.ui.session_view import create_session_view
print('✅ All components ready for testing')
"
```

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Full Live Session Interface Test

**Objective:** Test complete integrated interface with all components

**Steps:**
1. Launch demo app
2. Select "Full Live Session" 
3. Wait for demo to auto-start (shows recording state)
4. Observe simulated transcript entries appearing every 2 seconds
5. Watch audio visualizer showing simulated levels
6. Check session timer counting up
7. Verify status indicators showing connected states

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Demo starts automatically within 1 second
- ✅ Transcript shows speaker names with colored labels
- ✅ Audio bars update smoothly at ~30fps
- ✅ Timer shows MM:SS format (e.g., "00:42")
- ✅ Status indicators show green/connected states
- ✅ Interface responds to touch within 100ms

**Performance Targets:**
- Session startup: <1 second
- UI response: <100ms
- Audio visualization: 30+ fps
- Memory usage: <200MB for demo

6. Test long press on buttons for enhanced feedback
7. Try rapid tapping to test responsiveness

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Buttons respond immediately to touch

3. Scroll up/down through transcript history
4. Observe speaker color coding
5. Test auto-scroll behavior
6. Look for timestamp accuracy
7. Check text wrapping on long entries

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Smooth scrolling with 1000+ entries
- ✅ Speaker names clearly visible with distinct colors
- ✅ Timestamps in HH:MM:SS format
- ✅ Auto-scroll follows new entries
- ✅ Manual scroll disables auto-scroll temporarily
- ✅ Text wraps properly for long messages

**Scroll Performance Test:**
- Rapid scroll gestures should be smooth
- No lag or stuttering during scroll
- Memory usage stable with many entries

---

### 4. Audio Visualizer Test

**Objective:** Test real-time audio level visualization

**Steps:**
1. Select "Audio Visualizer" from menu
2. Observe bars updating in real-time (~30fps)
3. Look for variation in bar heights
4. Check smoothness of animation
5. Verify bars represent different frequency bands
6. Test for at least 30 seconds continuous operation

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 8 bars showing different levels
- ✅ Smooth 30+ fps updates
- ✅ Realistic variation in levels
- ✅ Colors change based on intensity (green→yellow→red)
- ✅ No stuttering or freezing
- ✅ Performance remains stable over time

**Visual Quality Test:**
- Bars should be clearly visible
- Colors should be distinct
- Animation should feel natural
- No visual artifacts or glitches

---

### 5. Status Indicators Test

**Objective:** Test system and connection status monitoring

**Steps:**
1. Select "Status Indicators" from menu
2. Observe initial status states (connected, normal, etc.)
3. Watch for status changes every 5 seconds
4. Check indicator colors and icons
5. Verify text labels are readable
6. Look for smooth state transitions

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Bluetooth shows "Connected" (green)
- ✅ Recording shows "Recording" (green) 
- ✅ Battery shows percentage with color coding
- ✅ Storage shows usage percentage
- ✅ System shows health status
- ✅ Status updates are smooth and clear

**Status Color Coding:**
- Green: Normal/Connected/Good
- Yellow: Warning/Medium
- Red: Error/Critical/Low
- Gray: Disabled/Unknown

### 6. Touch Interface Validation

**Objective:** Verify touch responsiveness and accessibility

**Touch Target Test:**
1. Measure button sizes (should be ≥44px)
2. Test touch accuracy on all controls
