      "text": "Hey G! What's up, man? So good to hear from you! How are things in Bakersfield? How are the kiddos, uh, doing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Hey Matt! Yeah, good to hear your voice too. Things are, uh, pretty chaotic as usual, you know, with three little cyclones running around. But good chaos, you know? How's LA? Still living the dream, I assume?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Oh, absolutely living the dream, man! Traffic, sunshine, more traffic. It's, uh, it's something else out here. No cyclones for us yet, just the occasional dust bunny tornado, haha. Sarah says hi, by the way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Tell Sarah I said hi back! And that she's smart for avoiding the kid tornado for now. So, I was actually calling, uh, well, partly just to catch up, but also I was thinking about, you know, our annual family vacation idea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Oh yeah, the legendary family vacation! I'm all ears, Greg. You know I'm always up for an adventure, especially if it means seeing you guys. What's on your mind? The mountains? The beach? A trip to, like, an alpaca farm?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Haha, maybe not the alpaca farm this year, Matt. I was thinking something a bit more, you know, practical for the kids. Maybe back to Colorado? Remember how much fun we had there a few years ago? The fresh air, the hiking... for *us*, I mean, not just the kids."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Colorado! Oh, I love Colorado! That sounds amazing, actually. When were you thinking? Because Sarah and I were just talking about maybe taking some time off, like, late next spring? Or maybe early summer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Yeah, that's what I was thinking too. Like, early July next year, maybe? Before it gets too hot here and before school starts up again. It gives us plenty of time to plan, you know? And for me to save up for all the extra snacks the kids will demand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "July! Perfect, absolutely perfect. I'll block that out, man. I'm already envisioning us on a patio, having a beer, while the kids, uh, play in the dirt or whatever kids do. This is great, G! I'm so stoked."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Me too, man. It'd be great to get everyone together. Uh, so, on that note, two quick things I wanted to mention, just so they don't slip through the cracks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Shoot! Lay 'em on me. My memory is a sieve these days, so, uh, definitely remind me of anything important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "First, uh, *remember to call Mom on her birthday on January 19th*. She already mentioned she's gonna be a little sad if her LA boy doesn't call, you know how she gets."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Oh, Mom's birthday! January 19th, got it. You know I would never forget, but it's good to have that reminder, especially with all the, you know, L.A. distractions. Definitely on my calendar now, thank you!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "No problem. And second, for the Colorado trip, can you *remember to look into some of those rental cabins near Breckenridge*? You always find the best deals, and I'm just swamped with work and the kids' soccer practices right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Breckenridge cabins, got it! Oh, I'm already on it, man. I'll hit up all the usual suspects â€“ Airbnb, VRBO, maybe even some of those smaller local places. I'll send you a few options by, uh, end of next week, how about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "That'd be awesome, Matt, seriously. You're the best. So, um, how's work going? Still enjoying the, uh, the tech world?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Yeah, it's good! Busy, you know, lots of new projects launching. It keeps me on my toes, which is good. Keeps me young, haha. How about you? Still wrangling those, uh, agricultural giants?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Pretty much! Same old, same old. It's steady, which is what I need right now with, uh, tuition costs looming. Speaking of kids, Liam just started T-ball, and it's, uh, it's quite a spectacle. He mostly just chases butterflies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Haha, Liam chasing butterflies in T-ball, that's gold! You gotta send me a video of that, man. Sounds adorable. So, um, any other big plans for the fall? Besides, you know, surviving the daily grind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Not really, just trying to keep all the plates spinning. Maybe a quick weekend trip to the coast if we can swing it, but nothing major. How about you and Sarah? Any big trips planned before July?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "We were thinking maybe a quick weekend in Santa Barbara or something, just a short drive. But honestly, knowing we have Colorado to look forward to next July is already making me happy. It gives us something concrete to plan for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Yeah, exactly. I think it'll be great. Plus, the kids will be a little older, which means they might actually remember it, haha. Or at least be less likely to eat the pinecones."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Haha, true! Less pinecone consumption is always a win. Alright, man, well, thanks for the call, seriously. And thanks for the reminders. I'll get on those cabins right away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Anytime, Matt. Always good to talk to you. You know, you never call! No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Seriously though, talk soon, okay? Give my love to Sarah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Will do, G! You too. Tell the little ones Uncle Matt says hi. And don't work too hard! Talk soon!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregory",
      "text": "Alright, you too. Bye!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt",
      "text": "Later!"
